    Good security practices foy you and your pet when going on playdates
  </h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Always meet in a public place: When meeting up with people for pet
      playdates, make sure to choose a public location that is safe and secure.
      A dog park or a public garden could be a good option.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep your dog on a leash: Even if your dog is well-behaved, it's important
      to keep them on a leash to ensure their safety and the safety of other
      dogs in the area.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure your dog is up-to-date on their vaccinations: Make sure your dog is
      up-to-date on their vaccinations and has received all necessary preventive
      treatments. This will help prevent the spread of any diseases or
      illnesses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Supervise your dog at all times: Keep a close eye on your dog and make
      sure they're not getting into any trouble or getting into fights with
      other dogs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring plenty of water: It's important to keep your dog hydrated,
      especially on hot days. Bring plenty of water and a bowl for your dog to
      drink from.
    </li>
    <li>
      Watch for signs of stress or aggression: Pay attention to your dog's
      behavior and watch for any signs of stress or aggression. If your dog
      starts to get anxious or agitated, it may be time to leave.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring toys and treats: Bring some toys and treats for your dog to play
      with during the playdate. This will keep them occupied and help prevent
      boredom.

      Clean up after your dog: Always clean up after your dog, whether it's
      urine or feces. Bring bags to dispose of waste properly and keep the area
      clean for others to enjoy.
