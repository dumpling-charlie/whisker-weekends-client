# Whisker Weekends (Client)

Whisker Weekends is a user-friendly web application designed for pet owners who want to connect with other pet owners and find playdates for their furry friends. The app allows you to create a profile for yourself and your pet, browse the planned playdates, chat to other users and see pet friendly locations recommended by them.

Whisker Weekends is built using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, which makes it fast and responsive. Whether you're a dog lover or a cat person, Whisker Weekends is the perfect tool to help you find new friends for your pets.
